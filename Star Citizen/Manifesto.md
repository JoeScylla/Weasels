WEASELS want to be a home for retired military personal with exceptional skills and experience.

For this reason we are able to deliver a wide array of security and para-military services that other Private Military Cooperations (PMC) are not able to. In addition to this we still maintain good connections with UEE Command and UEE Intelligence Command with information exchange that give us the edge in many situations.
